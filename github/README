README for github directory in jenkins-debian-glue
--------------------------------------------------

The script hook_server.rb provides a simple gateway between GitHub and
an (internal) Jenkins server to receive Git push actions from GitHub and
trigger Jenkins jobs accordingly. Place this script on a host which is
available from GitHub and has access to the (internal) Jenkins system as
well.

Instructions for usage:

* configure hook_server settings via config.yml
* adapt script hook_server.rb as needed
* install dependencies via bundle [http://bundler.io/]:
  bundle install --path=bundled --verbose --binstubs
* start service:
  bundle exec ./hook_server.rb
* enable hook settings of according project(s) under GitHub's "WebHook
  URL", usage example: http://webhook.example.local:8042/trigger
